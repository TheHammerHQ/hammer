# 🎈 Easy to Use

-   If you don't know how to make a Discord bot then you can start with just a simple command as `npx create-hammer <your_bots_name>`!
-   Everything is built on `discord.js`, which means if you already worked with it you are ready to step up further!
-   If you have absolutely 0 idea how to code a bot or even don't know coding, you can easily install 3rd party plugins and add it to your codebase, no coding skills required!
-   (WIP) If you don't want to mess with coding in any way, you can also use HammerGUI to create bots and add plugins to it!
-   If you already know some things about coding, then you can start to produce your own plugins in order others to use it with Hammer's simple plugin development API!

# 🏃 Quick Start

-   Create your bot without installing anything, with just one command:
    ```bash
    $ npx create-hammer <bot_name>
    ```
-   If you wan't to go further and start to develop your own plugins, everythins is same! Just run the same command:
    ```bash
    $ npx create-hammer <plugin_name>
    ```
-   After running this command, Hammer CLI tool will ask you some questions about your project. You should select the template according to your project.
