Hammer is still in development, you can join waitlist [here](https://hammer.338.rocks)!

We are looking for contributors to actively work on Hammer and to contribute to the repos. There is still lots of work to do. If you are interested in contributing, please join our [Discord server](https://hammer.338.rocks/discord). (There will be a surprise for early contributors!)
